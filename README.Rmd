# fishflux: A tool to model nutrient fluxes in fish

<img src="man/figures/fishflux.png" width = 120 alt="fishflux logo"/> 

## Overview

The **fishflux** package provides a tool to model nutrient fluxes in fish. It combines priciples from elemental stoichiometry and metabolic theory. The package offers a userfriendly interface to make nutrient dynamic modelling available for anyone. fishflux is mostly for fish ecologists, wishing to predict nutrient ingestion, egestion and excretion to study fluxes of nutrients and energy. 

## Underlying principle

The main function is using a mass balance approach, applying the principles of conservation of mass and...
Central modeled components are growth, metabolism and nutrient turnover. Using these components to model the fish's requirements for C (carbon), N (nitrogen) and P (phosphourous), allows for the prediction of processes such as ingestion, excretion and egestion. 

## Installing fishflux

```r
devtools::install_github("nschiett/fishflux")
```

fishflux: A tool to model nutrient fluxes in fish
=================================================

<img src="man/figures/fishflux.png" width = 120 alt="fishflux logo"/>

Overview
--------

The **fishflux** package provides a tool to model nutrient fluxes in
fish. It combines priciples from elemental stoichiometry and metabolic
theory. The package offers a userfriendly interface to make nutrient
dynamic modelling available for anyone. fishflux is mostly for fish
ecologists, wishing to predict nutrient ingestion, egestion and
excretion to study fluxes of nutrients and energy.

Underlying principle
--------------------

The main function is using a mass balance approach, applying the
principles of conservation of mass and… Central modeled components are
growth, metabolism and nutrient turnover. Using these components to
model the fish’s requirements for C (carbon), N (nitrogen) and P
(phosphourous), allows for the prediction of processes such as
ingestion, excretion and egestion.

Installing fishflux
-------------------

``` r
